This is Robert Supnik's Dungeon V3.2B for various DEC Fortrans (VMS, OSF/1,
and Unix), ported to MS-DOS.

The MS-DOS port was originally done by Volker Blasius in 1994, using
Microsoft Fortran PowerStation. Unfortunately, that version will only run
under MS-DOS and Windows 95/98/ME: it does not work under Windows NT/2000/
XP/2003 due to problems with the Fortran runtime.

I have built this version of the MS-DOS port using the DJGPP MS-DOS port of
the GNU G77 Fortran compiler. In order to use G77, I started with Robert's
original Dungeon sources, then added required changes from Volker's MS-DOS
port. These changes are given below.

Note that cwsdpmi.exe is only required if running under MS-DOS: under
Windows it is not needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- G77 OPEN() does not accept the READONLY argument, which has been removed.
  Affected modules: GAME.F

- The statement to write something to stdout is not TYPE but PRINT
  Affected modules: TIMEFNC.F

- G77 ITIME() takes an array of three integers, rather than three integer
  arguments.
  Affected modules: GAME.F, SUBR.F

- The random number routine in G77 is called RAND(), not RAN(), and the
  routine must be initialized with a call to SRAND().
  Affected modules: SUBR.F

- The record length of UNFORMATTED DIRECT file DTEXT must be specified in
  bytes, not in long words, so the definition of RECLNT in DPARAM.FOR has
  been changed from 20 (lw) to 80 (bytes).
  Affected modules: DPARAM.FOR

- Following a suggestion by Larry Brenkus,
    PAUSE '--More--' 
  has been inserted twice in the end-of-game code, to prevent the end-of-
  game messages from just flashing over the screen.
  Affected modules: ROOMS.F
